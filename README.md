# Circular-motion-demo
##INTRODUCE
###this is a animation demo based on canvas technology.in this demo i create an object,a ball,and this object has a circular motion math,it is not very tough to known that a circular motion can be decomposed to two equations "x=Rcos(a)" and "y=Rsin(a)" if you have the common sense in mathematics.so i design the circular motion math like this,this math change the angle parameter and the repaintting the object in the canvas in every frame.
##SUMMARIZE
###Every complex curvilinear motion can be decomposed to two simple linear motion.
